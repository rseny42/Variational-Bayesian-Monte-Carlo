# Variational-Bayesian-Monte-Carlo
Project for the course Bayesian Machine Learning, Skoltech, 2020

The project is based on the paper of Luigi Acerbi: \
https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05558

Goals: \
-implementaion of the Variational Bayesian Monte-Carlo algorithm (VBMC) proposed in the paper, \
-validate the method through experiments on lumpy, Student, cigar densities mentioned in the paper + new experiments, with densities that were not presented \
-compare the performance with the discussed SMC, AIS, BMC, WSABI-L, WSABI-M, BBQ, AGP, BAPE methods (possibly some others too)\
-implement an initial warm-up procedure to avoid spending computations in regions of low posterior probability mass
