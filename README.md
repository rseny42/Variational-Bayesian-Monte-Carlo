# Variational-Bayesian-Monte-Carlo
Project for the course Bayesian Machine Learning, Skoltech, 2020

The project is based on the paper of Luigi Acerbi: \
https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05558

Goals: \
-implementaion of the Variational Bayesian Monte-Carlo algorithm (VBMC) proposed in the paper, \
-validate the method through experiments on lumpy, Student, cigar densities mentioned in the paper + new experiments, with densities that were not presented \
-compare the performance with the discussed smc, ais, bmc, wsabi-L, wsabi-M, bbq, agp, bape methods (possibly some others too)\
-Implement an initial warm-up procedure to avoid spending computations in regions of low posterior probability mass
